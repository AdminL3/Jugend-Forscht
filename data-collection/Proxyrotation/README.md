# Proxyrotation

- I did not use this method, because of the Downsides
- I did use Requests for [The Guardian](../The%20Guardian/)

---

## Benefits:

- Rotate Proxys to avoid getting blocked
- You can get free Proxys at [Free Proxy List](https://free-proxy-list.net/)

---

## Downsides:

- Some Proxys do not work!
- Free Proxies are unfortunately very unreliable

---

## Usage:

1. **Install** Requests:

   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```

2. Check which Proxies work:

   - Download Proxies
   - Loop through them and save the working ones as a file

3. Use working proxies to access HTML

   - See [**2. Requests**](../Requests/)
   - See [The Guardian](../The%20Guardian/) for an example
